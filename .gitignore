Okay, here's a good starting .gitignore file for your Node.js Playwright scraper project. This file tells Git which files and directories it should intentionally ignore and not track.

# --- Node.js ---
# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log
yarn-error.log
lerna-debug.log

# Runtime data
pids
*.pid
*.seed
*.pid.lock

# Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover
lib-cov

# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
coverage
*.lcov

# nyc test coverage
.nyc_output

# Grunt intermediate storage (https://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins#storing-task-files)
.grunt

# node-waf configuration
.lock-wscript

# Compiled binary addons (https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)
build/Release

# Dependency directories
jspm_packages/

# Snowpack dependency directory (https://snowpack.dev/)
web_modules/

# TypeScript cache
*.tsbuildinfo

# Optional npm cache directory
.npm

# Optional eslint cache
.eslintcache

# Microbundle cache
.rpt2_cache/
.rts2_cache_cjs/
.rts2_cache_es/
.rts2_cache_umd/

# Optional REPL history
.node_repl_history

# --- Playwright ---
# Playwright installs browsers here, can be large
# Note: Depending on your setup, Playwright might install browsers globally
# or in node_modules/.bin/playwright-core/.browsers, which is covered by node_modules/
# Add specific paths if browsers are installed elsewhere unexpectedly.
# Example: playwright-browsers/

# --- Project Specific ---
# Output files generated by the scraper
*_report.csv
errors.log
scraper_state.json
files.py
project_scan.txt

# Sensitive configuration (uncomment if your proxies are private/paid)
proxies.txt

# Optional: Uncomment if you don't want to commit specific filter/config lists
# user_agents.txt
# email_filter.txt
# excluded_domains.txt
# excluded_extensions.txt
# excluded_patterns.txt
# blocklist_patterns.txt

# Input data (optional - uncomment if you don't want test/input CSVs in repo)
# *.csv

# --- Operating System Files ---

Explanation of Key Project-Specific Additions:

node_modules/: Essential to ignore installed dependencies.

*.log, errors.log: Ignores general log files and the specific error log from your script.

*_report.csv: Ignores the generated report files (using a wildcard * handles different input filenames).

scraper_state.json: Ignores the state file containing visited URLs.

proxies.txt: Important: Ignored by default. If your proxy list contains private or paid proxies, you definitely don't want to commit it to a public repository. If they are public/free and part of the standard setup, you could remove this line, but ignoring is safer.

Other .txt files (commented out): These configuration lists (user_agents.txt, etc.) could be committed if they represent the standard configuration. They are commented out here to give you the option â€“ uncomment them if you prefer not to track changes to these specific lists in Git.

*.csv (commented out): If you have input CSV files (like test.csv) that you don't want in the repository, uncomment this line. Often, it's okay to commit a small example input file.

.env: Added as it's common practice to store sensitive API keys or configurations in .env files, which should never be committed.

How to Use:

Save this content in a file named exactly .gitignore (note the leading dot) in the root directory of your project (the same directory where your package.json and script file reside).

If you've already tracked any of these files with Git, you'll need to untrack them:

git rm --cached <file_to_remove>
# Example:
git rm --cached errors.log
git rm --cached scraper_state.json
# If node_modules was accidentally added:
git rm -r --cached node_modules
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Commit the .gitignore file itself to your repository:

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Now, Git will ignore these files and directories going forward.
